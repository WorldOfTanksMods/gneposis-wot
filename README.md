Hex To Do
---------
    0. Installer script and settings
    1. Easy loading and refreshing of mods (I. using downloads; II. using repositories if possible) and the whole package: 
    2. Ultimate Conquest tracking (more than one pillars needed: I. trying to get from the official site II. using <http://wot-stats.appspot.com>'s RSS, III. trying to negotiate with wotconquest.com guys, IV. parsing replays IV. import from all sources should be identical if nothing went wrong)
    3. Clan tracking (same as with Ultimate Conquest tracking)
    4. dossier_cache tracking (another pillar)
    5. cloud (for sharing the known stats)
    6. command prompt; flag command to (cw, premium)
    7. getting experience bonus value; ability to calculate exp_corr
    8. getting roster with the use of wot-xvm; getting team_level (even for tanks) and battle type (which would replace flags)
    9. knowledge base (using official update informations aswell: gneposis-wot-committee (availability to change their modifier on a game component value; regular cleanups))
    A. resource sharing and statistics on clan's private website or FTP server
    B. global sharing site (with no permissions, with replays if possible, I will probably need to pledge for donations at this point)
    C. getting a good security programmer for making able to host clan battles and stats aswell (with advanced permissions system and diplomatic feature)
    D. getting modules and crew and settings for all tanks                                 
    E. getting victim names with use of wot-xvm                             
    F. head-to-head head-to-clan head-to-squad squad-to-squad clan-to-clan / division (same shit: that needs many server resources)
